# Overboard RIT

Ahoy matee! Thar be the development team behind **Overboard**, a senior capstone project at RIT. This organization serves as the central hub for our project's development, documentation, and collaboration.

## About Overboard  
*"The floor is lavaâ€¦ but in a shipwreck!"*

Overboard is a **time-based "floor is lava" survival game** where shipwrecked pirates must navigate a hazardous arena, collect doubloons, and avoid peril before the rescue boat arrives. The game takes place in a **15' x 10' play area** using **top-down floor and wall projections**, with player movement tracked via **two Kinect v2 sensors**. The game is built in **Unity 6** for interactive projections and UI.

## Repository  

This organization hosts a single repository for Overboard, containing all source code, assets, and documentation.
